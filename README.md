# 🪨 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The player competes against the computer — first to 3 points wins! This project was developed as part of the [freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/), focusing on JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.
